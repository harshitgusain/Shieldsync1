Today, practically all businesses, regardless of size, rely on technology to operate. Nowadays, a lot of things are done online, including storing customer data, processing payments, and just interacting with clients. However, there is a drawback to this move to technology and the internet: there are many cyberthreats, and regrettably, small and medium-sized enterprises are typically the ones most frequently targeted.

Many small and medium-sized enterprises lack the resources or sizeable IT departments necessary to put in place comprehensive cybersecurity protections. This makes them susceptible to potentially fatal threats like ransomware, phishing, and data breaches. These kinds of attacks on smaller businesses have been more frequent in the past few years.
ShieldSync is the name of this project. This project was created to help bridge this gap. It is a straightforward, interactive website that was created with the primary goal of raising cybersecurity awareness among our SMBs. It also offers other benefits like secure login and setup forms and the option to ask cybersecurity-related issues when assistance is needed. For those firms who require it, we want to be able to make it easier and more approachable.
